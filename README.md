Simple Network wrapper for Mobile Computing Group 5. 

Uses simple heuristics like battery percentage and wifi or signal strength to decide when to transmit. 

Also uses priority at request level from different apps. 

Simple to setup, clone the repo, open in android studio, let the build sync and test the three priority levels available. 

Tomcat logs shall reflect when the msg was added to queue and when it is processed. 

THis is rule based decision layer proof of concept only and not a fully working model.
